										<h2>The data journey...</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Using a sales data from a department store of 1000 sales over a year, I explored the following questions:<br />
									<br />
									How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?<br />
									Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?<br />
									Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?<br />
									How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends?<br />
									</p>
									<p>After loading Pandas and Matplotlib and the data set, I inspected in to understand what cleaning was needed.<br />
									I reloaded the data and parsed the 'Date' to datetime type as I knew this would be needed to explore my questions.
									</p>

                                    <span class="image">

                                    <p>Following this I wanted to get an overview of key metrics, using .describe() to do this. It was interesting to<br />
									see the average age of shoppers being 41. The min and max Total Spend also gave insight in to a wide range of<br /> 
									customers and their spending habits.
									</p>

                                    <p>I then began to look into how purchasing behaviours differed by gender. With an expected higher spend on beauty<br />
									products by female customers. However, spending in other categories remains similar between the genders, as can be<br />
									seen below.

                                    <p>Furthre analysis of gender spending as demonstrated using the boxplots below, indicate very similar spending<br />
									habits between genders. There is a slightly higher median spend by female customers, which may help to explain the<br />
									differences in beauty spending between the genders.

                                    <span class="image">

                                    </span>
									<p>I conducted analysis of spending over different time periods, including using '.dt.daysofweek' to explore possible<br />
									trends. The two visuals below demonstrate sales by month and by week over the year. Despite individual weeks of higher<br />
									sales around the Christmas holidays, the month with the largest sales was infact May.
									</p>
                                    <div style="text-align: center;">
										<img src="images/Python Project/Sales by month.jpg" style="display:inline-block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%;" alt="Responsive centered image">
										<img src="images/Python Project/Sales by week.jpg" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%;" alt="Responsive centered image">
									</span>
									<p>Finally, I analysed spending by age group. As seen in the visual below, interestingly the highest average spend was by <br />
									the 18-21 age group. Further questions which can be explored include average spend by age group and product type to better <br />
									understand why the youngest demographic spent the most.
									</p>
